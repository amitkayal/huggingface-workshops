        "> 🤗 Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you’re looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, 🤗 Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on usability over performance, simple over easy, and customizability over abstractions.\n",
